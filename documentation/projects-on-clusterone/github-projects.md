If you use GitHub to store your machine learning code, it's very easy to link that code to Clusterone. Simply [connect your GitHub](doc:github-account) to your Clusterone account, and you can create projects directly from the code in a GitHub repository.

See [here](doc:code-on-clusterone) for an overview of other available options for storing project code.

## Create a Project linked to GitHub

Log into the [Matrix](https://clusterone.com/matrix). Toggle the switch on the left side to show your projects. Click on the **Add Project** button in the center.

In the wizard, select **Link GitHub repository**.

If you don't see the GitHub button in the project creation wizard, your GitHub account isn't linked correctly. Make sure you follow the instructions to [connect your Github account to Clusterone](doc:github-account)."
{% endhint %}

On the next page, select the repository that you want to link from the drop-down menu.
