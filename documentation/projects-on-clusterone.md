Code on Clusterone is organized into projects. Each project contains code stored in a Git repository. To run the code, you have to create a job within the project.

There are two types of projects: 
- Projects with code hosted on Clusterone
- Projects linking to a GitHub repository

Both types are used in the same way when creating and running jobs. However, there are a few differences regarding the functions they support. See the table below for a list of the differences.
